# Informative Sample Annotation-based Contrastive Active Learning for cross-domain patient-ventilator asynchrony detection
---

## Abstract
Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA), a prevalent complication in mechanical ventilation, poses significant clinical challenges including prolonged ventilation duration, elevated mortality risk, and compromised patient outcomes. While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise for PVA detection, current methodologies face critical limitations in cross-institutional generalization due to substantial waveform pattern variations arising from the complex interplay between patient pathophysiology and ventilator operational parameters. These variations, further amplified by institution-specific ventilator control mechanisms, create substantial annotation bottlenecks in identifying representative waveform signatures from vast pools of morphologically similar cycles. To overcome these challenges, we present INTELLI-PVA - an INformaTivE contrastive active LearnIng framework for cross-domain PVA detection that synergizes two core innovations: 1) Random Augmentation-based Contrastive Learning (RACL) for robust feature representation, and 2) Multi-task Class-balanced Active Learning (MTCAL) for intelligent sample selection. This dual strategy enables efficient identification of high-information-density samples while maintaining pathological class balance, achieving domain adaptation with minimal annotation burden. This study establishes a paradigm-shifting approach for ventilator waveform analysis that effectively addresses key barriers to clinical AI implementation, with direct implications for improving critical care monitoring systems and ventilator management protocols.
